# esp32-motion-presenter

ESP32-based Bluetooth presentation remote with IMU gesture recognition and on-device TinyML inference.

The device uses an MPU-6050 inertial sensor to recognize hand gestures and convert them into presentation commands. The gesture recognition model runs directly on the ESP32 using TensorFlow Lite Micro.

The project currently targets dual-core ESP32 devices:

- ESP32-WROOM-32 — Xtensa LX6
- ESP32-S3 — Xtensa LX7

The current implementation was developed and tested primarily on the ESP32-WROOM-32.

# About the project

This is my student project focused on embedded systems and TinyML.

1. TinyML and machine learning for data classification on microcontrollers
2. Working with IMU sensors
3. Communication between embedded devices and computers
4. Running machine learning inference on resource-constrained devices

The project combines these areas into a wireless presentation remote with gesture recognition.

The device supports:
- Manual control using physical buttons
- Gesture-based presentation control
- Bluetooth HID
- BLE/GATT communication
- IMU data collection
- On-device neural network inference
- Debugging and inference result transmission

# Current status

The main data collection and processing pipeline has been implemented and tested.

The TinyML model is successfully running directly on the ESP32.

Current results:
- 8 gesture classes
- model on 11640 parametrs
- ~77-80 ms average inference time
- ~95% test-set accuracy
- Gesture recognition performed entirely on the microcontroller
- Inference is executed on the second CPU core

The current model recognizes:
```
 - CircleCCW
 - CircleCW
 - NormalHandMovement
 - SwipeDown
 - SwipeLeft
 - SwipeRight
 - SwipeUp
 - Unknown
```
# TODO

1. Work is underway to compile a dataset and develop training methods for a new model to improve gesture detection.
2. Enable dataset collection and device debugging via BLE/GATT.
3. Finish implementing functions for collecting various debugging information.

# Gesture recognition pipeline

The complete machine learning pipeline consists of several stages:

```
IMU data -> collection data -> preparation data -> windows generation -> model training -> Quantization/Export to .h model 
-> include to ESP32 -> TinyML inderence -> Gesture voting ->  Bluetooth HID command
```
# Dataset generetion
## STEP 1 - Data collection

Movement data was collected using a prototype of the device. This dataset includes:
```
SwipeLeft: 85 gestures. Total samples: 7923
SwipeRight: 85 gestures. Total samples: 8174
SwipeUp: 85 gestures. Total samples: 7455
SwipeDown: 85 gestures. Total samples: 8807
CircleCW: 40 gestures. Total samples: 7696
CircleCCW: 40 gestures. Total samples: 7439
NormalHandMovement: 3 gestures. Total samples: 6686
Unknown: 2 gestures. Total samples: 7047
```

## STEP 2: Data preparation

The data was prepared using a custom C++ application: extraneous information was trimmed, and start- and end-of-movement flags were set.
![Scheme](img/ExampleTrim.png)

This makes it possible to extract training windows while preserving the temporal structure of each gesture.
The data preparation tool is one of my projects available on GitHub.

## STEP 3: Data export

Current parameters:
- Sampling rate: 250 Hz (4 ms sample period)
- Window: 50 samples (200 ms motion)
- Base stride: 20 samples (80 ms)
- Random jitter: ±N samples around each window boundary
- Stop condition: >25% overlap with the end-of-motion flag

For each gesture, windows are extracted sequentially. The first window's 
position is randomized near the start-of-motion flag. Each subsequent 
window is placed with a new random offset from the previous window's end. 
Slicing stops when a window overlaps the end flag by more than 25% of 
its size. This randomized slicing mimics real-device conditions, where 
the window boundary relative to the gesture start is not fixed.

# Training model

The data is exported to the specified directory and sorted into folders associated with the movement class.
Using python scripts and PyTorch model is trained, quantized, and prepared in .h format.

The trained model is then:
1. trained on the generated dataset
2. evaluated
3. quantized
4. post-quantization verification
5. converted into a C/C++ header
6. included directly in the ESP32 firmware


# Model evaluation

The current model achieved approximately 95% accuracy on the test dataset after quantization.

```
The scripts I use are located in the "/scripts" folder.
```

These results are based on the prepared test dataset and should not be interpreted as the real-world recognition rate of the final device.

When using the model on the device, accuracy decreases due to:
1. transitions between gestures (the window may contain too little information about the gesture)
2. This is due to the small dataset, which was trained on the gestures of only two people. In reality, gesture mechanics can vary drastically from person to person.

## Running the model in device

The weights file is moved to the project's code folder. If the model has been modified, the parameters in `modelConfig.h` are updated. `modelConfig.h` is the single source of truth for anything model-specific:

- `MODEL_WINDOW` / `MODEL_CLASSES` — window length and class count
- `enum ClassId` — class index order must match the training report (`labels.txt`)
- `gestureActionById()` — class-to-action binding (which gesture triggers which command)
- `CLASS_NAMES` — class names for serial debug output
- `MODEL_MEAN` / `MODEL_STDDEV` — input normalization parameters from training

An inconsistent `MODEL_CLASSES` vs `ClassId` fails at compile time via `static_assert`. The code is then compiled (the project currently uses the Arduino IDE) and flashed onto the microcontroller.

For the ESP32-WROOM-32 (Xtensa LX6 core), the current firmware uses: :
```
Sketch uses 1285561 bytes (61%) of program storage space. Maximum is 2097152 bytes.
Global variables use 46028 bytes (14%) of dynamic memory, leaving 281652 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 327680 bytes.
```

The current partition scheme is:
```
NO OTA ( 2MB APP / 2MB SPIFFS ) 
```

## Gesture decision logic

A single inference is not enough to trigger a presentation command.

The current firmware uses consecutive inference results and confidence filtering to reduce accidental commands.

The current logic requires:
- more than two consecutive matching inferences
- model confidence above 75%
- a voting condition between recent predictions
- 600 ms cooldown after sending a command

This prevents the same gesture from repeatedly triggering the HID command while the hand is still moving.

# Usage experience

In informal testing, the recognition rate depends strongly on the gesture and execution style.

Subjectively observed results:
- CircleCCW and CircleCW: approximately 90–95%
- SwipeRight: approximately 90–95%
- other swipe gestures: approximately 85%

The HID command is successfully triggered in approximately:
- 7–8 out of 10 attempts for swipe gestures
- 9–10 out of 10 attempts for rotation gestures

These numbers are based on personal testing rather than a controlled benchmark.

# Performance

On ESP32-WROOM-32 (Xtensa LX6 core):

The current model contains:
- Parameters: 11,640
- average inference time: ~77–80 ms

On ESP32-WROOM-32 (Xtensa LX7 core):
-not tested

Inference is performed locally on the ESP32 without sending the motion data to a computer for classification.

This is one of the main goals of the project: keeping the complete gesture recognition pipeline on the embedded device.

# Communication

## BLE
Used for send HID (uman Interface Device) commands.
Examples inclide:
- SwipeRight -> next slide
- SwipeLeft ->previous slide

## Physics buttons
Used for send HID commands:
- BTN_UP
- BTN_DOWN
- BTN_LEFT
- BTN_RIGHT
- BTN_PLAY

Used to interact with the device
- BTN_GESTURE -> on press switch gesture mode
- BTN_PLAY -> on realesed after 5s hold -> start debug mode
- BTN_LEFT -> on hold 600 ms -> debug IMU on serial port or bluetooth

## BLE/GATT (in work)
BLE/GATT is being developed for:

- Dataset collection
- Device debugging
- Sending IMU data
- Receiving configuration information
- Collecting inference information
